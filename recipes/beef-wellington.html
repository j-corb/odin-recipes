    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Something about Beef Wellington</p>
    <p>Something else about Beef Wellington</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lb center-cut beef tenderloin, trimmed</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tbsp of Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1/2 lb. of mixed mushrooms, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>1 shallot, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>Leaves from 1 thyme sprig</li>
        <li>2 tbsp of unsalted butter</li>
        <li>12 thin slices of prosciutto</li>
        <li>All-purpose flour</li>
        <li>14 oz. of frozen puff pastry, thawed</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>flaky salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Using kitchen twine, tie tenderloin 
            in 4 places. Season generously with 
            salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Over high heat, coat bottom of a 
            heavy skillet with olive oil. 
            Once pan is nearly smoking, sear 
            tenderloin until well-browned on 
            all sides, including the ends, about 
            2 minutes per side (12 minutes total). 
            Transfer to a plate. When cool enough 
            to handle, snip off twine and coat all 
            sides with mustard. Let cool in fridge.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make duxelles: In a food 
            processor, pulse mushrooms, shallots, 
            and thyme until finely chopped.</li>
        <li>To skillet, add butter and melt over 
            medium heat. Add mushroom mixture 
            and cook until liquid has evaporated, 
            about 25 minutes. Season with salt and 
            pepper, then let cool in fridge.</li>
        <li>Place plastic wrap down on a work surface, 
            overlapping so that it's twice the length 
            and width of the tenderloin. Shingle the 
            prosciutto on the plastic wrap into a rectangle 
            that's big enough to cover the whole tenderloin. 
            Spread the duxelles evenly and thinly over the 
            prosciutto.</li>
        <li>Season tenderloin, then place it at the bottom 
            of the prosciutto. Roll meat into prosciutto-mushroom 
            mixture, using plastic wrap to roll tightly. 
            Tuck ends of prosciutto as you roll, then twist 
            ends of plastic wrap tightly into a log and 
            transfer to fridge to chill (this helps it maintain 
            its shape).</li>
        <li>Heat oven to 425°. Lightly flour your work surface, 
            then spread out puff pastry and roll it into a 
            rectangle that will cover the tenderloin (just a 
            little bigger than the prosciutto rectangle you 
            just made!). Remove tenderloin from plastic wrap 
            and place on bottom of puff pastry. Brush the 
            other three edges of the pastry with egg wash, 
            then tightly roll beef into pastry.</li>
        <li>Once the log is fully covered in puff pastry, 
            trim any extra pastry, then crimp edges with a 
            fork to seal well. Wrap roll in plastic wrap to 
            get a really tight cylinder, then chill for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove plastic wrap, then transfer roll to a foil-lined 
            baking sheet. Brush with egg wash and sprinkle with 
            flaky salt.</li>
        <li>Bake until pastry is golden and the center registers 
            120°F for medium-rare, about 40 to 45 minutes. Let 
            rest 10 minutes before carving and serving.</li>
